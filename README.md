# Test-Driven-Development
A simple js library system, that is used to test my understanding of different array methods.


Folder structure:

I used tinytest.js designed by joewalnes as a testing library.
In the example folder I have created html files for the following methods on arrays: for each, filter, map and reduce.
      
      
Description:

Inside of each file there is a prototype implementation of each specific method, followed by a list of test requirements that describe the method. The list of tests has been created by following the Mozilla Developper Network(MDN) documentation on Array.prototype methods and re-creating each of methods to behave like the native ones.
